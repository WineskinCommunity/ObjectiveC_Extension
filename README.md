# ObjectiveC_Extension
Once I started developing my skills in Objective-C, I've noticed that while many things were pretty easy to do, others could be heavily simplified. I started with a `NSUtilities` class, which later became lots of extensions splitted in `+Extension` files. At some point, I had a separated folder for extensions and classes which I would import to almost every Objective-C project that I was involved.

In order to improve that, I've decided to create a framework with those classes and extensions, in order to optimize my work. It should be useful for a large range of projects, so feel free to use it, and enjoy :)

## Compatibility
This is the best part of that framework. ObjectiveC_Extension is compatible with every version of macOS still compatible with Xcode 9, so it is compatible with macOS 10.6+. Obvisouly, that requires some workarounds and *hacks*. They will be listed in the end of that document.

## New Classes (related with keycodes and devices)
Those classes were made to simplify the use of HID devices input, making your code cleaner when working with them, and more Objective-C-like, since most of the code related with that is C-like and C++-like. It also gives you enums to find the value of virtual keycodes (useful to simulate keyboard key pressing) and usage keycodes (useful to detect which keyboard key was pressed).

### CGVirtualKeycodes
A class which makes working with Mac Virtual Keycodes easier.

```objectivec
+(NSArray*)allKeyNames;
```

```objectivec
+(NSDictionary*)virtualKeycodesNames;
```

Name of Mac Virtual Keycode by keycode.

```objectivec
+(void)performEventOfKeycode:(CGKeyCode)keyCode withKeyDown:(BOOL)keyPressed;
```

Simulates the button press/release of a Mac Virtual Keycode.

### IODeviceObserver

Name of keyboard keys that have a usage keycode.

```objectivec
+(NSDictionary*)usageNamesByKeycode;
```

Name of keyboard keys by usage keycode.

```objectivec

```objectivec
+(BOOL)showBooleanAlertMessage:(NSString*)message withTitle:(NSString*)title withDefault:(BOOL)yesDefault withSettings:(void (^)(NSAlert* alert))setAlertSettings;
```

Creates an "Yes/No alert" with the specified title, message and default value (which will be the selectable key by pressing Return), and lets you do anything with the alert in the block before running its modal. That alert uses the thread safe modal.

```objectivec
+(BOOL)confirmationDialogWithTitle:(NSString*)prompt message:(NSString*)message withSettings:(void (^)(NSAlert* alert))setAlertSettings;
```

Creates an "Ok/Cancel alert" with the specified title and message, and lets you do anything with the alert in the block before running its modal. That alert uses the thread safe modal.

```objectivec

## Workarounds and Hacks

### [NSData jsonStringWithJsonObject:object] (macOS 10.6)
The JSON string is created manually since `NSJSONSerialization` was not available before macOS 10.7.

### [NSData dataWithJsonObject:object] (macOS 10.6)
The JSON data is created based in the function above since `NSJSONSerialization` was not available before macOS 10.7.

### [(NSData*)object jsonObject] (macOS 10.6)
The JSON object is created using `SZJsonParser` since `NSJSONSerialization` was not available before macOS 10.7.

### [(NSImage*)img saveAsIcnsAtPath:path] (macOS 10.6)
In macOS 10.7+ systems, icns files are created with `iconutil`, using `tiff2icns` only if the first one does not return a valid image. macOS 10.6 systems create using `tiff2icns` only, since `iconutil` was introduced in macOS 10.7.

### [(NSOpenPanel*)panel setWindowTitle:title] (macOS 10.11 ~)
From macOS 10.11 and on, the `setTitle:` function does nothing to `NSOpenPanel`'s. Considering that, this function uses `setMessage:` for macOS 10.11+ and `setTitle:` for macOS 10.10-.

### [(NSString*)string componentsMatchingWithRegex:regex] (macOS 10.6)
This is the dirtiest hack of them all. Since `NSRegularExpression` was introduced in macOS 10.7, the only method that I found to do that (since old macOS 10.6 frameworks do not compile anymore) is using Python. In macOS 10.6 only, that function will create a temporary file with `string` and a temporary python script which should parse string and return the components matching with `regex`. It's very slow, and should not be used multiple times in sequence (nor simultaneously!). At least it works using the same kind of regex that `NSRegularExpression` accepts... please, forgive me.

### [NSNotificationUtility showNotificationMessage:message withTitle:title withUserInfo:info withIcon:icon withActionButtonText:actionButton] (~ macOS 10.7)
Since `NSUserNotification` was only introduced in macOS 10.8, macOS 10.7 and below require a different approach. In those systems, `NSNotificationUtility` shows a simple `NSAlert` instead of the notification. A better approach for the future would be to add Growl integration instead.
