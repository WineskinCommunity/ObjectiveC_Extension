# ObjectiveC_Extension
Once I started developing my skills in Objective-C, I've noticed that while many things were pretty easy to do, others could be heavily simplified. I started with a `NSUtilities` class, which later became lots of extensions splitted in `+Extension` files. At some point, I had a separated folder for extensions and classes which I would import to almost every Objective-C project that I was involved.

In order to improve that, I've decided to create a framework with those classes and extensions, in order to optimize my work. It should be useful for a large range of projects, so feel free to use it, and enjoy :)

## New Classes (related with keycodes and devices)
Those classes were made to simplify the use of HID devices input, making your code cleaner when working with them, and more Objective-C-like, since most of the code related with that is C-like and C++-like. It also gives you enums to find the value of virtual keycodes (useful to simulate keyboard key pressing) and usage keycodes (useful to detect which keyboard key was pressed).

### CGVirtualKeycodes
A class which makes working with Mac Virtual Keycodes easier.

```objectivec
+(NSArray*)allKeyNames;
```

List of all the Mac Virtual Keycodes names.

```objectivec
+(NSDictionary*)virtualKeycodesNames;
```

Dictionary of the Mac Virtual Keycodes names by keycode.

```objectivec
+(NSString*)nameOfVirtualKeycode:(CGKeyCode)key;
```

Name of Mac Virtual Keycode by keycode.

```objectivec
+(void)performEventOfKeycode:(CGKeyCode)keyCode withKeyDown:(BOOL)keyPressed;
```

Simulates the button press/release of a Mac Virtual Keycode.

### IODeviceObserver

```objectivec
+(instancetype)sharedObserver;
```

```objectivec
-(void)observeDevicesOfTypes:(NSArray*)types forDelegate:(id<IODeviceObserverManagementDelegate>)actionDelegate;
```

```

Name of keyboard keys by usage keycode.

```objectivec
+(NSUInteger)runThreadSafeModalWithAlert:(NSAlert* (^)(void))alert;
```

Lets you declared a `NSAlert` inside a block (which will run in the main thread) and returns itsÂ value. Equivalent to `runThreadSafeModal`, but lets you declare objects needed by your `NSAlert` in the main thread as well, avoiding concurrency problems.

```objectivec
+(void)showAlertMessageWithException:(NSException*)exception;
```

+(void)showAlertOfType:(NSAlertType)alertType withMessage:(NSString*)message;
```

Creates an "Ok alert" with the specified message, with a title and an icon defined by the `alertType` (Sucess, Warning, Error, Critical and Custom). That alert uses the thread safe modal.

```objectivec
+(void)showAlertAttributedMessage:(NSAttributedString*)message withTitle:(NSString*)title withSubtitle:(NSString*)subtitle;

```objectivec
+(BOOL)showBooleanAlertOfType:(NSAlertType)alertType withMessage:(NSString*)message withDefault:(BOOL)yesDefault;
```

Creates an "Yes/No alert" with the specified message and default value (which will be the selectable key by pressing Return), with a title and an icon defined by the `alertType` (Sucess, Warning, Error, Critical and Custom). That alert uses the thread safe modal.

```objectivec
+(BOOL)showBooleanAlertMessage:(NSString*)message withTitle:(NSString*)title withDefault:(BOOL)yesDefault withSettings:(void (^)(NSAlert* alert))setAlertSettings;
```

Creates an "Yes/No alert" with the specified title, message and default value (which will be the selectable key by pressing Return), and lets you do anything with the alert in the block before running its modal. That alert uses the thread safe modal.

```objectivec
+(BOOL)confirmationDialogWithTitle:(NSString*)prompt message:(NSString*)message withSettings:(void (^)(NSAlert* alert))setAlertSettings;
```

Creates an "Ok/Cancel alert" with the specified title and message, and lets you do anything with the alert in the block before running its modal. That alert uses the thread safe modal.

```objectivec
+(NSString*)inputDialogWithTitle:(NSString*)prompt message:(NSString*)message defaultValue:(NSString*)defaultValue;
```

Creates an "Ok/Cancel input alert" with the specified title, message and default value (which will be the initial value of the text input field of the alert). Any input provided in the field will be returned by the function. That alert uses the thread safe modal.
